# 1DV609 Assignment 2

This repository contains exploratory testing of the ESLint library.

## How to run

Start by installing all dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Then run lint

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Details

The exploratory testing consists of rather useless functions in the different modules in the `src` folder.

## Output

When running the linting script, two outputs are created. One instantly visible in your CLI, the other is an hmtl-version saved in the root-folder of the project called `lint_report.html`.
