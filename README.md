# 1DV609 Assignment 2

This repository contains exploratory testing of the ESLint library.

## How to run

Start by installing all dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Then run lint

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Details

The exploratory testing consists of rather useless functions in the different modules in the `src` folder.

## Output

When running the linting script, the result will be output to the command line using the `stylish` formatting. If you want to create an html-report, use the following command.

```bash
npm run lint:html
```

The output will be saved in a file named `lint_report.html` in the project root-folder.
